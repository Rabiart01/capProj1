    As an ISTQB-certified Quality Assurance Engineer, I bring four years of robust experience in software testing across Android, iOS, and Web platforms. My journey began at IgeeksNg in Nigeria, where I designed over 400 test scenarios and championed effective communication between QA and development teams. My tenure at Testify, Nigeria, further allowed me to support uplifts in team productivity, with a memorable achievement of creating over 1800 regression test scenarios that transitioned our team towards a 30% reduction in manual testing hours.

    In my current role at Oze Limited, I've developed test automation scripts, played pivotal roles in risk mitigation, and transformed raw data into actionable insights, raising team efficiency impressively. In parallel, my voluntary role as a Software Testing Trainer at SkillNG saw me curating a rich curriculum with an 85% success rate among students. I owe this accomplishment to my hands-on workshops and collaboration with industry professionals.
    With an academic foundation from Nottingham Trent University and the University of Ibadan, my skill set boasts a vast understanding of QA methodologies, tools, and processes, complemented by proficiency in Mobile API Testing, SQL, Java, HTML, Katalon Studio, and more. My commitment to continuous learning is evident with ASTQB, Udemy, and LinkedIn certifications.

<p>
    I've been privileged to work on transformative projects like Oze, which empowers small businesses; Movebot, a comprehensive delivery and tracking solution; and Testify, an agency dedicated to pristine software testing services. I am passionate about evolving in the QA realm and am pursuing further certifications to solidify my expertise.
